                      I utilize my time studying, reading books sometimes, listening to music and sketching. 
                      Life itself is an adventure and is also full of adventures. Adventure is an exciting experience or a daring undertaking, full of risks and challenges. 
                    I like adventure so I travel in my free time. </p>

                <h2>MY JOURNEY TO COMPUTER SCIENCE</h2>
                <p>
                    Computer science, itself a world, was a new word for me when I was studying in class two.
                     Everyone talked about computers, science and technology, but even there is not a smart phone in my home.
                      I went to <b>Katwashi Mai Boarding School</b>  near my house where Computer subjects were also included in our courses. 
                      In the beginning, when the teacher taught us the computer every word was gone out of my mind.
                       Teachers and other students talked about the internet, data, Wi-Fi, Facebook, YouTube, etc. 
                       which I had never listened to before. These terms made me curious to know about it.
                        I began to understand a little bit about it while I was studying in class five. 
                        I wanted to know more about it but I didn’t have any smart gadgets where I could research.
                          During that time my sister lived far away from home due to her higher level education,
                           and only she used a smartphone. When she returned on vacation, I used to utilize her phone to satisfy my curiosity.
                            I was trying to expand my knowledge of technology that made me more curious. The whole world is connected to science 
                            and technology and I also wanted to be a member of technology.
                             But I didn't understand when it became the journey of my life.
                              It became a beautiful innocent dream that always inspires, motivates, and fascinates me to do something and
                               I thought it would be a more interesting field for my career development. And how fast time was gone, 
                               I passed class ten. And it was time to choose a major subject for further study. I preferred to study Computer Science.
                                But my parents and relatives wanted me to study commerce. Because it is an easy way to make money and settle in life.
                                 But I wanted to give priority to my interested subject and I told them about it. My parents are understanding, 
                                 they listen to me and support my interest. They let me choose a Computer science subject for further study. 
</p>

<p>I moved to the capital city of Nepal (Kathmandu), got an admission in <b>Reliance College</b>, 
    situated at Chabahil, Kathmandu. And then my college life  started, i was able to study my
     favorite subject as a major subject i.e. Mathematics. That’s why I also joined a mathematics (or physical) group where
      I could study both mathematics and computer science. Mathematics is my all-time favorite book. I feel happy and energetic 
      while I study it. But I  computers were my first love. Because my happiness and love are interconnected with each other.
       I always got first position in mathematics. It helped me a lot to learn about computer languages like<b> HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, C, DATABASE</b>,
        etc. and develop logic. Still I had to involve myself in class assignments, and wasn't able to give enough time 
        to these things. Even though, whenever I got free, I wanted to mitigate the thirst of curiosity related to computers. 
        I was involved in YouTube in searching videos related to programming languages and tried to understand and learn them. 
        In the beginning it was difficult to understand.
         But I never give up....</p>
<p> Here my college life ended.</p>

<p>As I have cleared my vision of pursuing a career in the field of computer science.
     I wanted to grab an opportunity to continue my journey in oversea countries. But due to financial problems, I couldn’t go abroad. 
    And then I have prepared for the BE entrance exam. Luckily, I passed. I have enrolled in
    <b>Bachelor in Engineering in Department of Computer Engineering in IoE Purwanchal Campus, Dharan</b>.</p>

<p>Vacation starts….</p>

<p>I was enjoying my holidays. But time was ruthless to me. I was seriously injured in a bike accident. My right leg was fractured.
     Doctor suggested that I get complete bed rest for three months. That’s why I couldn’t move here and there and did any physical work.
      I felt bad for myself. But I took it as an opportunity to enhance my mental skill in this critical situation. 
     I started searching for different online programming courses. I learned <b>HTML, CSS, Django, Bootstrap and C </b>completely. 
  Furthermore, I was involved in learning other languages like <b>Java Script, UX/UI design </b> and <b>Python</b>. 
  But I haven’t completed it yet. I developed my own website using <b>HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT</b> however I don’t have hosted it yet. </p>


<p>Now it is time to welcome as a fresher on campus. Classes are about to start,
 I will reach there in a few days. Because my leg is not fully recovered yet.
  Finally I reached my destination i.e. <b>studying as a computer engineering student in Purwanchal Campus, Dharan, Nepal</b>. 
  Life never stops for anyone so this phase of my  life is going now....
